### General Info

The game is pretty simple, it involves play to use the **increement** and **decreement** buttons to increase or decrease the prediction value of their number and when they are ready they can click on the **Guess** button to initiate the game, then the game shows the user the target number, computer's guess and the winner based on whose guess was closest to the target. After that user can move on to the next round of the game and repeat the process again to play the game. There's scorecard which keeps track of the number of round and score of user and the pc both.
